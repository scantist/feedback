# FAQs

1. Why do I get the 'No compatible GitHub respositories were found' message?

The Scantist SCA currently only supports C and C++ for now. If you don't have any existing C or C++ repo in your GitHub account, this message will be shown. Please create or fork a C/C++ repository to start using the service.

2. Why do I need to provide read and write permissions to my GitHub account?

GitHub only allows full-scope OAuth tokens, or none at all. As a result, we need to request for read and write access. But rest assured, we will not write/push anything to your repositories without your explicit approval.
